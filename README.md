# [Facile](https://facilesistemas.net.br) Challenge

>Status: Finished ‚úîÔ∏è

### That's a challenge created by Facile, and this is my code solving this problem üí° Objective was to create a encryptor using NodeJs.
---
## Sistem functions 
+ Add a new name and encrypt 
+ Validate the name and the routes
+ Decrypt if you send the ID
---
## Routes

+ GET - /  ```(Receive a JSON saying a message, and my GitHub)```
+ GET - /encrypts/:id  ```(Receive a JSON with the object data of the sent ID)```
+ POST - /encrypts   ```(Encrypt the name received and save on DataBase)```
---
## Observations 
+ To dowload the packages use NPM install
+ You can change the NPM start to node instead nodemon
+ Don't forget to change the file (.env_example) to (.env )
+ On .env put all your variables 
+ Server will run in localhost !
+ If you still have doubts watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAHjdua-wYs)
